      1. I like my neighborhood because it's a quiet and convenient place to live.
      2. I live in an apartment complex near the downtown area.
      3. Although it's close to downtown, my town is pretty quiet.
      4. I use public transportation to get around.
      5. The only neighbor I talk to is Mr.Lee who lives upstairs.
      6. We run into each other about once a week.
      7. We usually have a conversation when we both get into the elevator.

      13. When I first moved into my house, everything was brand new.
      14. First of all, I bought a new refrigerator.
      15. The old one broke down and made a weird sound.
      16. The new one is a lot bigger than the old one, so we can put more stuff inside.
      17. My new bed is really big and takes up a lot of space.
      18. My apartment is small and cozy.
      19. I hope I could get a top-floor apartment so that nobody lives above me.
