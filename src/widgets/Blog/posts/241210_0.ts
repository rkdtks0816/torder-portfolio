      1. I got to thinking about fate
      2. I got your back
      3. I just came to hang out
      4. I just got everything I need
      5. I know what you're doing
      6. I made a commitment
      7. I messed up
      8. I screwed up
      9. I see where this is going
      10. I wouldn't know
      11. I wouldn't miss it
      12. I'll make it work
      13. I'll take that as a "no"
      14. I'm all about her
      15. I'm all over it
      16. I'm all yours
      17. I'm good to go
      18. I'm listening
