      1. I once won the race in the women's 100m freestyle.
      2. I know all the strokes, and my favorite stroke is freestyle.
      3. My mom signed me up for swimming lessons at a sports center.
      4. He actually was a really good swimmer, and I learned from him a lot.
      5. I think of him is a great instructor, but I'm still a little scared of him.
      6. Indoor pools were boring. So, I asked my parents to take me to the beach.
      7. My mom made me wear a life jacket.
      8. I got very tired and had no energy to swim, and of course, I was pretty far from the shore.
      9. I started to drown and I was so scared.
      10. It was the scariest thing ever. And since then, I don't really like to swim in the ocean.
      11. It's a used mountain bike with 24 gears.
      12. I usually go riding on my bike along the bank.
      13. I always wear my helmet when I ride my bike.
      14. My dad put two training wheels on the reer wheel so that I would't fall down.
      15. Bicycles with four wheels don't go as fast as two wheeled ones.
      16. He held my bike from the back until I could ride by myself.
      17. He showed me wounds he got from mountain biking.
      18. I decided to give it a try.
      19. Suddenly, a dog jumped in front of me, and I had to slam on the brakes.
      20. I couldn't hear his owner calling out the dog's name.
